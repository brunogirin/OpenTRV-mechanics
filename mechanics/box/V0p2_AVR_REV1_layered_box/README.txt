Built around standard 5cm x 5cm board (with M3/3mm corner mounting holes, 1mm from edge).

M3 bolts with 30mm shank and full-height (2.4mm) nuts should then be correct length
with 0.5mm recess at top 30mm case height.

4 layers totalling 30mm:

0. (11mm) Base + screw mounts and lower collar with micro-usb cut-out.
1. (6mm) Top collar with power and boiler wire cut-outs.
2. (30.5mm-others) Spacer to provide clearance for front-panel items (and possibly to match bolt length!).
3. (3mm) Front panel with supports for button/LED/LDR board and cut-outs for those 4 items.
